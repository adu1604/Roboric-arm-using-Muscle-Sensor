# Roboric-arm-using-Muscle-Sensor
🤖 This project features a robotic arm that flexes its fingers using real-time muscle signals detected by an EMG sensor 💪. The EMG data is processed by a microcontroller (like Arduino) to control servo motors 🦾. It’s a hands-on biomechatronics demo blending robotics, bio-signals, and hardware control! ⚡🖐️
